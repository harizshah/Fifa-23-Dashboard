Dear Sze Mun,

I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Data Engineer with AIA Digital+, which I learned about through LinkedIn.

Based on my experience as Data Engineer, I believe that I would be a strong contributor to your team. As I have hands-on projects on Azure Environment by building end-to end projects from building the data pipeline using Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics and more. You can refer my project on my LinkedIn or GitHub as for references.

Please see my attached CV for more detail regarding my background and let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding potential next steps.
